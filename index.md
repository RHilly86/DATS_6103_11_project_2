## Text Analysis of CARES Bot From Data For Progress

For this project, I analyzed open-ended survey responses from a survey fielded by Data For Progress, a liberal polling firm, in which respondents were asked about how the CARES Act has impacted them. Using `tweepy`, `pytesseract`, `spacy` and `nltk`, I extracted and analyzed the text from the responses in order to glean insight on what words/phrases respondents used to talk about the CARES Act and see if different kinds of respondents used different words/phrases when talking about the CARES Act.
