I haven't qualified for unemployment but still lost my job so I've been relying on gig work from home and the first stimulus payment to pay the bills and now I'm sitting here watching our elected officials bicker about how much money to give people like me but not actually helping us. They can fight over how much money the people should get but we're not getting anything the whole time they're bickering. Other countries are giving their citizens thousands a month and we can't even get a second stimulus payment.
